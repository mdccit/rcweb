            receive messages and material that are proper and related to the particular Communication Service.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">By way of example, and not as a limitation, you agree that when using a Communication
            Service, you will not: defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or otherwise violate the legal rights (such as
            rights of privacy and publicity) of others; publish, post, upload, distribute or disseminate any

            necessary consents; upload files that contain viruses, corrupted files, or any other similar software or
            programs that may damage the operation of another's computer; advertise or offer to sell or buy any goods or

            reserves the right to review materials posted to a Communication Service and to remove any materials in its
            sole discretion. Recruited reserves the right to terminate your access to any or all of the Communication
            Services at any time without notice for any reason whatsoever.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Recruited reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to
            satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post or
            to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, in Recruited's sole discretion.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Always use caution when giving out any personally identifying information about yourself or
            your children in any Communication Service. Recruited does not control or endorse the content, messages or
            information found in any Communication Service and, therefore, Recruited specifically disclaims any

            Communication Service. Managers and hosts are not authorized Recruited spokespersons, and their views do not
            necessarily reflect those of Recruited.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Materials uploaded to a Communication Service may be subject to posted limitations on
            usage, reproduction and/or dissemination. You are responsible for adhering to such limitations if you upload
            the materials.</p>

            "Submissions"). However, by posting, uploading, inputting, providing or submitting your Submission you are
            granting Recruited, our affiliated companies and necessary sublicensees permission to use your Submission in

            copy, distribute, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, reproduce, edit, translate and reformat your
            Submission; and to publish your name in connection with your Submission.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">No compensation will be paid with respect to the use of your Submission, as provided
            herein. Recruited is under no obligation to post or use any Submission you may provide and may remove any
            Submission at any time in Recruited's sole discretion.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">By posting, uploading, inputting, providing or submitting your Submission you warrant and

        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Third Party Accounts:</b> You will be able to connect your Recruited account to third
            party accounts. By connecting your Recruited account to your third party account, you acknowledge and agree
            that you are consenting to the continuous release of information about you to others (in accordance with
            your privacy settings on those third party sites). If you do not want information about you to be shared in
            this manner, do not use this feature.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>International Users:</b> The Service is controlled, operated and administered by
            Recruited from our offices within the USA. If you access the Service from a location outside the USA, you
            are responsible for compliance with all local laws. You agree that you will not use the Recruited Content
            accessed through recruited.pro in any country or in any manner prohibited by any applicable laws,
            restrictions or regulations.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Indemnification:</b> You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Recruited, its
            officers, directors, employees, agents and third parties, for any losses, costs, liabilities and expenses
            (including reasonable attorney's fees) relating to or arising out of your use of or inability to use the
            Site or services, any user postings made by you, your violation of any terms of this Agreement or your
            violation of any rights of a third party, or your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations.
            Recruited reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter
            otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with Recruited in
            asserting any available defenses.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Arbitration:</b> In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute between
            them arising out of or concerning these Terms and Conditions, or any provisions hereof, whether in contract,
            tort, or otherwise at law or in equity for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be resolved
            only by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral
            arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration service
            selected by the parties, in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator's award shall be
            final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In the event that any legal or
            equitable action, proceeding or arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms and Conditions, the
            prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney's fees. The parties agree to
            arbitrate all disputes and claims in regards to these Terms and Conditions or any disputes arising as a
            result of these Terms and Conditions, whether directly or indirectly, including Tort claims that are a
            result of these Terms and Conditions. The parties agree that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the
            interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The entire dispute, including the scope and enforceability
            of this arbitration provision shall be determined by the Arbitrator. This arbitration provision shall
            survive the termination of these Terms and Conditions.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Class Action Waiver:</b> Any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions will take
            place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class/representative/collective actions are not
            permitted. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN EACH'S INDIVIDUAL
            CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE
            PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER. Further, unless both
            you and Recruited agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may
            not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

            respect to such use. If any part of this agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to
